Content: painter with 8 shapes (Three levels of inheritance):
                                    ------> Rectangle     ------> Square

Base class - Figure     ------> Ellipse           ------> Circle

                                    ------> Triangle         ------> Equilateral triangle      (more understandable in painter chart PP)
                                                                        ------> Right triangle

In the left lower corner you have the design options - frame and filling colors (every slider have a range of color
(red, green and blue) between 0 to 255 like in RGB), and bold or not frame.
Also you can drag the shapes only by clicking somewhere inside the shape.
At last you can use the undo, redo and clear buttons and also you can save your creations or load others.

Thank you very much!
